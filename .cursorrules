# Cursor Rules for Customify Shopify App

## Environment Variables Status
- All Vercel environment variables are properly configured
- SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN is set in Vercel Dashboard
- Do NOT ask about environment variables configuration
- Do NOT ask about Vercel Dashboard settings
- Do NOT ask about token values or setup

## Current Project Status
- Shopify app is installed and working
- OAuth flow is complete
- App has proper permissions in Shopify
- Vercel deployment is functional

## Debugging Focus
- Focus on code issues, not environment setup
- Check function logic and implementation
- Look for runtime errors or logic problems
- Verify API calls and responses

## Key Files
- api/status.js - App status checker
- api/test.js - Environment variables test
- api/install.js - OAuth installation
- vercel.json - Vercel configuration

## Common Issues to Check
- Function syntax and exports
- API endpoint routing
- Error handling in functions
- Response formatting
- CORS configuration
