# Cursor Rules for Customify Shopify App

## Environment Variables Status
- All Vercel environment variables are properly configured
- SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN is set in Vercel Dashboard
- Do NOT ask about environment variables configuration
- Do NOT ask about Vercel Dashboard settings
- Do NOT ask about token values or setup

## Current Project Status
- Shopify app is installed and working
- OAuth flow is complete
- App has proper permissions in Shopify
- Vercel deployment is functional

## Debugging Focus
- Focus on code issues, not environment setup
- Check function logic and implementation
- Look for runtime errors or logic problems
- Verify API calls and responses

## Key Files
- api/status.js - App status checker
- api/test.js - Environment variables test
- api/install.js - OAuth installation
- vercel.json - Vercel configuration

## Project Goal
Customify is a Shopify app that allows customers to:
1. Upload their own photos on product pages
2. Use AI (Replicate API) to transform/modify the photos with various styles
3. Preview the AI-modified image
4. Add the customized product to cart for printing
5. Pay for the physical printed version

The app integrates with Shopify for product management and uses Vercel for API processing.

## Common Issues to Check
- Function syntax and exports
- API endpoint routing
- Error handling in functions
- Response formatting
- CORS configuration
